# CSI4999 IDS in IoT using AI Solutions

A practical comparision demonstrating:

- **RT-IoT-2022** usage for **binary, malicious or benign, network traffic classification**  
- **ML models** (ensemble-based) for training and comparison
- **DL model** (RNN-based) for training and comparison
- **Inference and Testing**

**Separate dataset download required** - https://doi.org/10.24432/C5P338

## Overview

This repository, **CSI4999_IDSwithAI**, demonstrates ML and DL internet network classification on **RT-IoT2022**. After training, the project saves a checkpoint (`{model}.pth`) that you can copy for usage in desired ways to perform inference.

## Features


## Project Structure

You have **1** main Python files:

```
.
├── dataPreprocessing.py   # Loads and splits RT-IoT2022; Visualizes data structure
└── requirments.txt/environment.yml          # Dependencies/Environment needed for this project
```

## Installation

### Creating & Activating a Conda Environment

1. **Install** [Anaconda/Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) if you haven’t already.  
2. **Create** a new environment (example name: `edgeai`):  
   ```bash
   conda create -n iot_ids python=3.12
   ```
3. **Activate** it:  
   ```bash
   conda activate iot_ids
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

Within your **activated** conda environment:

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
OR
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Or, if you prefer `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(Make sure you are in the conda environment so packages are installed there.)*

**Typical Requirements** (already in `dependencies.txt`):
- Python 3.12 (or similar)
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- Matplotlib (for plotting)
- scikit-learn (for classification reports)

## Usage

### 1. Data Preparation

**Manual download** required. 

dataPreprocessing.ipynb splits the dataset into **train** and **test** sets (80/20).

### 2. Model Training


### 3. Evaluation
